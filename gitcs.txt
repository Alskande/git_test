This is a reference list of the most commonly used Git commands. (You might consider bookmarking this handy page.) Try to familiarize yourself with the commands so that you can eventually remember them all:

Commands related to a remote repository:

    git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
    git push or git push origin main (Both accomplish the same goal in this context)


Commands related to the workflow:
    git add .
    git commit -m "A message describing what you have done to make this snapshot different"


Commands related to checking status or log history
    git status
    git log

The basic Git syntax is program | action | destination.
For example,
    git add . is read as git | add | ., where the period represents everything in the current directory;
    git commit -m "message" is read as git | commit -m | "message"; and
    git status is read as git | status | (no destination).

Flow
    git add filename - Adds saved file to "waiting room"
    git commit - final version of file is ready for upload
        if you don't put git commit -m "TEXT HERE", second prompt will appear
    git push - uploads files

Difference between git add and git commit:

git add: takes a modified file in your working directory and places the modified version in a staging area. 
git commit: takes everything from the staging area and makes a permanent snapshot of the current state of your repository that is associated with a unique identifier.
